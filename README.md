The Healthcare Management project is designed to showcase advanced skills in securing web applications and managing user access through the 
implementation of robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. 
This project demonstrates the use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens), JPA Security, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to create a secure and efficient healthcare management system.

Key Features:
Appointment Management: It includes functionalities for checking availability, booking slots, and updating appointment details, ensuring an organized and efficient workflow for healthcare providers and patients.
Billing System: The system ensures accurate billing and seamless integration with appointment and patient data.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implements RBAC to manage user permissions based on their roles (e.g., doctors, patients, administrative staff). This ensures that users can access and modify only the information pertinent to their roles, enhancing security and operational efficiency.

Hereâ€™s a detailed workflow for a patient creating an appointment, followed by medical record creation, and then billing.
This workflow illustrates how these processes interact and ensures that each step is efficiently handled.
Patient login into the healthcare platform and requests an appointment. Though a staff can schedule a appointment on belf of the patient as well.
Patient needs to mention the department and the reason. System validates the request, checks the availability of the doctor, and confirms the appointment.and send the doctors details and timedate slot to the patient. 
System creates an Appointment entry in the database with details such as patient ID, doctor ID, appointment date and time, and status.
Doctor creates or updates the medical record in the system with details such as diagnosis, treatment, prescriptions, and any additional notes.
System generates a billing record based on the services provided ones the appointment is closed.

Database relationships 
Patients to Appointments: One-to-Many (One patient can have many appointments)
Doctors to Appointments: One-to-Many (One doctor can have many appointments)
Patients to Medical Records: One-to-Many (One patient can have many medical records)
Doctors to Medical Records: One-to-Many (One doctor can create many medical records)
Patients to Billing: One-to-Many (One patient can have many billing records)
Departments to Doctors: One-to-Many (One department can have many doctors)

Security and Data Privacy:
Encryption: Use encryption for sensitive data (e.g., patient contact info, medical records).
Access Control: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized personnel can access or modify data.
Auditing: Keep audit logs for data access and changes to maintain a history of who accessed or modified records.
